NMACC presents, for the very first time in India, Infinity Mirrored Room―The Eternally Infinite Light of the Universe Illuminating the Quest for Truth, 2020. The scintillating room-sized installation is the work of the pathbreaking Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama. The pioneer of contemporary art has consistently leveraged the combined power of numerous disciplines, including performance, painting, and sculpture, in ways that are stunningly original. Part of the Infinity Mirror Rooms  the artists landmark series that was initiated in 1965 this immersive work holds the distinction of being one of the largest infinity rooms by Kusama, scattered around the world.

What to expect? A breathtaking, mirror-panelled room with hundreds of LED lights suspended at varying heights from the ceiling. The lights flicker on and off, producing a rhythmic illumination of the space that never remains constant - creating a world of limitless, ethereal optical illusions.

The myriad reflections afforded by the mirrors, which include the viewer’s image, eradicate the sense of a fixed perspective and offer the impression of a seemingly infinite universe where nothing is as it seems.

The prestigious artwork, part of a permanent art collection at the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre, joins Kusama’s famed Clouds at the venue. Visitors can also view the public art installation of 90 organically shaped stainless-steel clouds to round out their Kusama experience. Besides Clouds, the Centre has nine other unique installations dotted around its concourses.

The installation will remain closed from October 23 to December 1. Bookings are open for slots starting December 2.`,

Time Throttle is a progressive rock band that has existed since 2019. It was only after 2 years of rigorous practice and refining their product that Time Throttle made its debut performance with a 75 min setlist. 



Over the next 2 years, Time Throttle added more songs to their setlist making it 120+ mins long with some of the most loved songs by Tool (multiple Grammy award winning progressive band from USA) like The Pot, Sober, Schism, Lateralus, Rosetta Stoned, Parabol + Parabola, Descending, Vicarious, 46&2, Right in Two, and No Quarter (by Led Zeppelin). 



Through this journey of performing and covering Tool’s music, Time Throttle started finding its own voice and composing original music, heavily inspired by Tool and other progressive rock acts from around the world. Time Throttle has now reached a point where they wish to perform their original music in front of the world. 



To not announce and conclude the Tool Tribute shows abruptly will perhaps be a disservice to the millions of Tool and progressive rock lovers in India. Time Throttle is therefore announcing and initiating its last Tool tribute tour in India - performing at all Hard Rock Cafes all over India over 2 weekends in April 2024. 



Time Throttle has performed Tool Tribute shows at least once in all the cities of this tour except Kolkata and Chennai - ironically making it the first and last shows here! 



Time Throttle will perform some of their original music in this last Tool Tribute tour in India to present a taste to the audience about what’s to come and what to expect. 



The audience at Time Throttle shows is kind and respectful to each other and they come in big numbers. The energy of Tool, prog, and now Time Throttle lovers is addictive, inspiring, and inviting for everyone to join the fun. `,
